# terraform-web-aws
Developing highly available Web infrastructure on AWS using Terraform

## Introduction
Project demonstrates the creation of a high-availability web infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.  

The architecture includes a **VPC**, public and private **subnets**, **security groups**, two **EC2 web instances** in different **Availability Zones**, and an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for traffic distribution.  

The solution implements the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), a modular configuration structure, and a Git-oriented workflow with Pull Requests, which is in line with modern DevOps practices.

## Tech Stack

- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- **AWS** (VPC, EC2, ALB, Security Groups)
- **Git + GitHub** (branching, Pull Requests, code review)
- (Optional) **GitHub Actions** for `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`
